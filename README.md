Hello I'm Xeno, and this is my work it's a basic bash script having few commonly used utilities.

This is not yet ofuscated or encrypted, so yes you can -rwx- more clearly. I have plans of making it more capable, and would love to have reviews, comments and suggestion as what more can be added.

Thanks XENO.
